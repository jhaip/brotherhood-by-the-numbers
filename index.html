<h1> Brotherhood: By the Numbers</h1>
<p>
    Is the house bill too high?  This semester we voted for an in house bill of $3,985, the 
    highest house bill Pilam has ever had.  Yet you could still argue that we pay about the 
    same amount as someone in a Baker Quad (the cheapest on campus housing) if you include 
    food and so maybe we aren’t doing so bad.  In this sort of essay I don’t want to make 
    the decision for you but give you a perspective on what is really impacting our house 
    bill.  This does not mean to question legitimate reasons to not live in the house or 
    claim that it is ideal, but to emphasize the purely financial aspects of Pilam and 
    keeping our house at 450 Beacon Street.
</p>

<p>
    This is an interactive essay. The numbers and formulas behind our financials
    are included with the words so that changing their values changes the text.
    Text that is blue can be dragged left and right to change it's value.

<h2>The Housing Bylaw Change</h2>

<p>
    First, a little history.  In 2012, the Pilam Corporation wanted to raise the rent we 
    pay to stay at 450 Beacon because of rising costs.  The undergraduate representatives 
    resisted this proposal, citing that the an increase in the rent with so few brothers 
    living in the house would push the house bill over $4000.  The Pilam Coorporation took 
    this as a sign that our policies on brothers moving in the house and rushing were too 
    relaxed and that we would not be able to afford 450 Beacon.  The undergrad’s rebuttal 
    was a new addition to our chapter’s bylaws that would guarantee enough money was 
    brought in by each pledge class such that the house could be sustained without outrageous 
    fees.  The exact text is below:
</p>

<blockquote>
    Section 4: Living in the House
    <br>
    A. All members shall live in the house the first semester they are able. <strong>At 
    minimum a pledge class is responsible for paying for 12 house bills. If the pledge 
    class has fewer than 12 active members, the pledge class is responsible for paying 
    for as many house bills as there are active members in that pledge class.</strong> 
    With the understanding that no rule can accommodate all situations, if a brother is 
    unable to abide by this policy, the Judicial Chairman shall form a committee to review 
    the reasons for living out-of-house. If the committee decides that the brother does 
    not have sufficient reason to live out-of-house, the committee may enforce penalties 
    on the brother under review which may include, but are not limited to fines or 
    placement in bad standing. For brothers initiated prior to the year 2012, penalties 
    will not be applied.
</blockquote>

<p>
    The bylaw was supposed to be a motivator on two fronts: guarantee a relatively stable 
    house bill and as a motivator in rush to the necessity of having larger pledge classes. 
    So far neither of these goals have been met.  Judicial committees have been voting to 
    not follow the bylaw and have waived the fees. This isn't surprising because no one wants
    a pledge class to be charged a fee but this affects what everyone pays.  In the next
    section we'll dive more into the numbers of Fall 2015.

<h2>A different style of budget meeting</h2>

<p>
Imagine if in the budget meeting instead of differentiating between in house and on 
campus brothers, we assumed that every eligible brother lived in the house.  For Spring 
2015 this would have meant a house bill of 
$<strong><span data-var="a_allin_housebill" data-format="%.0f"></span></strong> 
instead of the actual $3975.  Let’s say 
<span data-var="a_nbro_outhouse" class="TKAdjustableNumber" data-min="1" data-max="20"> brothers</span> 
then announced that they did not want to live in the house.  Lack of contribution by 
an out of house brother would be moved to the rest of the brothers in the house who 
each would have to write an addition check for 
<strong>$<span data-var="a_inhouse_extrafee" data-format="%.0f"></span></strong>.  
Perhaps the brothers' reason for not moving in the house would convince everyone to pick up the 
$<span data-var="a_inhouse_extrafee" data-format="%.0f">, perhaps not.  People deciding 
to live on campus isn’t seen this way, but this is what is happening.  
Would you pay for another brother to live on campus?
    </p>

    <Br>
    <h2>More than just living in the house</h2>

Brothers deciding to live on or off campus isn’t the only hidden factor that actually has a big impact on house bills:

<p><i>What if the average class size increase by <span data-var="classSizeIncrease" class="TKAdjustableNumber" data-min="1" data-max="10"> brothers</span>?</i></p>

<p>The house is officially capable of housing around 40 brothers.  Up until 1998 ? when freshman weren’t required to live on campus for their first year, rush wasn’t over until the house was completely full.  Ever notice why older composites are so much bigger?  This meant an average of 10 members per pledge class in house.  Currently 25 brothers live in the house, or an average of 8 brothers per class.  With 15 less brothers living in the house than 10 years ago it isn’t surprising the house feels empty and alumni complain about how good things used to be.</p>

<p><i>What happens when <span data-var="noPayHouseBill" class="TKAdjustableNumber" data-min="1" data-max="10"> brothers</span> per semester don’t pay their house bill?</i></p>

<p><i>What if no brothers were allowed to graduate with debt to the house and recent alumni payed back their debt to the house?</i></p>

<p><i>What if there were no depledges?</i></p>

<p><i>What if 2 brothers per pledge class debrothered?</i></p>
