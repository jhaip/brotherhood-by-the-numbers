		<h1> Brotherhood: By the Numbers</h1>
		<p>
		Is the house bill too high?  This semester we voted for an in house bill of $3,985, the highest house bill Pilam has ever had.  Yet you could still argue that we pay about the same amount as someone in a Baker Quad (the cheapest on campus housing) if you include food and so maybe we aren’t doing so bad.  In this sort of essay I don’t want to make the decision for you but give you a perspective on what is really impacting our house bill.  This does not mean to question legitimate reasons to not live in the house or claim that it is ideal, but to emphasize the purely financial aspects of Pilam and keeping our house at 450 Beacon Street.

        <h2>The Housing Bylaw Change</h2>

		<p>
		First, a little history.  In 2012, the Pilam Corporation wanted to raise the rent we pay to stay at 450 Beacon because of rising costs.  The undergraduate representatives resisted this proposal, citing that the an increase in the rent with so few brothers living in the house would push the house bill over $4000.  The Pilam Coorporation took this as a sign that our policies on brothers moving in the house and rushing were too relaxed and that we would not be able to afford 450 Beacon.  The undergrad’s rebuttal was a new addition to our chapter’s bylaws that would guarantee enough money was brought in by each pledge class such that the house could be sustained without outrageous fees.  The exact text is below:
		</p>

		<blockquote>
		Section 4: Living in the House
		<br>
A. All members shall live in the house the first semester they are able. <strong>At minimum a pledge class is responsible for paying for 12 house bills. If the pledge class has fewer than 12 active members, the pledge class is responsible for paying for as many house bills as there are active members in that pledge class.</strong> With the understanding that no rule can accommodate all situations, if a brother is unable to abide by this policy, the Judicial Chairman shall form a committee to review the reasons for living out-of-house. If the committee decides that the brother does not have sufficient reason to live out-of-house, the committee may enforce penalties on the brother under review which may include, but are not limited to fines or placement in bad standing. For brothers initiated prior to the year 2012, penalties will not be applied.
		</blockquote>

		<p>
		The bylaw was supposed to be a motivator on two fronts: guarantee a relatively stable house bill and as a motivator in rush to the necessity of having larger pledge classes.  Neither of these goals have been met so I would like to explore the monetary impact if we continue to have the same outcomes in Rush and continue to allow brothers to live on campus without consequence.
		</p>

		<h2>Examining Fall 2015</h2>

		<p>The judicial meeting this semester will determine if the bylaws are followed but I would like to take a moment to consider Fall 2015 when the Circle Jackers will be gone and the Jailbaters will be moving into the house:</p>

	    <p id="example">
	    	Let us say <span data-var="numMMOutOfHouse" class="TKAdjustableNumber" data-format="format_nobrothers 6" data-min="0" data-max="6"></span> Minute Men,
	    	<span data-var="numCWOutOfHouse" class="TKAdjustableNumber" data-format="format_nobrothers 13" data-min="0" data-max="13"></span> Chilly Willies,
	    	and <span data-var="numJBOutOfHouse" class="TKAdjustableNumber" data-format="format_nobrothers 10" data-min="0" data-max="10"></span> Jailbaters
	    	live out of house in Fall 2015.

	    	The Minute Men <span data-var="MMrequirement"></span>.  The Chilly Willies <span data-var="CWrequirement"></span>.  The Jailbaters <span data-var="JBrequirement"></span>.
	    </p>
	    <p>Fees per class:</p>

	    <table border=0 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=0>
	    	<tr>
				<td>Minute Men</td>
				<td>&nbsp;=&nbsp;</td>
				<td nowrap>
                    <span data-var="mm_extrahousebills"></span> house bills &times; $<span data-var="housebill" class="TKAdjustableNumber" data-min="3000" data-max="4500" data-step="100"> house bill</span> &minus; <span data-var="numMMOutOfHouse"></span> &times; $<span data-var="outhousebill" class="TKAdjustableNumber" data-min="100" data-max="1000" data-step="50"> out of house bill</span>
                </td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td></td>
				<td>&nbsp;=&nbsp;</td>
				<td nowrap>$<span data-var="mm_totalfine"></span> total or $<span data-var="mm_perbrofine" data-format="%.0f"></span> extra per Minute Man</td>
			</tr>

			<tr>
				<td>Chilly Willies</td>
				<td>&nbsp;=&nbsp;</td>
				<td nowrap>
                    <span data-var="cw_extrahousebills"></span> house bills &times; $<span data-var="housebill" class="TKAdjustableNumber" data-min="3000" data-max="4500" data-step="100"> house bill</span> &minus; <span data-var="numCWOutOfHouse"></span> &times; $<span data-var="outhousebill" class="TKAdjustableNumber" data-min="100" data-max="1000" data-step="50"> out of house bill</span>

			<tr>

				<td>&nbsp;=&nbsp;</td>
				<td nowrap>$<span data-var="cw_totalfine"></span> total or $<span data-var="cw_perbrofine" data-format="%.0f"></span> extra per Chilly Willy</td>
			</tr>

			<tr>
				<td>Jailbaters</td>
				<td>&nbsp;=&nbsp;</td>
				<td nowrap>
                    <span data-var="jb_extrahousebills"></span> house bills &times; $<span data-var="housebill" class="TKAdjustableNumber" data-min="3000" data-max="4500" data-step="100"> house bill</span> &minus; <span data-var="numJBOutOfHouse"></span> &times; $<span data-var="outhousebill" class="TKAdjustableNumber" data-min="100" data-max="1000" data-step="50"> out of house bill</span>

			</tr>
		</table>

        <p>This would cause the in house bill to go from $3950 to $<span data-var="inhousebill_after_fines"></span> and the out of house bill to go from $850 to $<span data-var="outhousebill_after_fines"></span>.

		<p>This is equivalent to:</p>

		<h3><span data-var="casesofbeer" data-format="%.0f" > cases of beer</span></h3>
		<h3><span data-var="dinnersathsinhsin" data-format="%.0f"> dinners at Hsin Hsin</span></h3>
		<h3><span data-var="rushes" data-format="%.1f"> Fall Rushes</span></h3>

		<br>

		<h2>A different style of budget meeting</h2>

		<p>Imagine if in the budget meeting instead of differentiating between in house and on campus brothers, we assumed that every eligible brother lived in the house.  For Spring 2015 this would have meant a house bill of $<strong><span data-var="a_allin_housebill" data-format="%.0f"></span></strong> instead of the actual $3975.  Let’s say <span data-var="a_nbro_outhouse" class="TKAdjustableNumber" data-min="1" data-max="20"> brothers</span> then announced that they did not want to live in the house.  Lack of contribution by an out of house brother would be moved to the rest of the brothers in the house who each would have to write an addition check for <strong>$<span data-var="a_inhouse_extrafee" data-format="%.0f"></span></strong>.  Perhaps a brother’s reason for not moving in the house would convince brothers to pick up the $<span data-var="a_inhouse_extrafee" data-format="%.0f">, perhaps not.  People deciding to live on campus isn’t seen this way, but this is what is happening.  Would you pay for another brother to live on campus?
		</p>

		<Br>
		<h2>More than just living in the house</h2>

		Brothers deciding to live on or off campus isn’t the only hidden factor that actually has a big impact on house bills:

		<p><i>What if the average class size increase by <span data-var="classSizeIncrease" class="TKAdjustableNumber" data-min="1" data-max="10"> brothers</span>?</i></p>

		<p>The house is officially capable of housing around 40 brothers.  Up until 1998 ? when freshman weren’t required to live on campus for their first year, rush wasn’t over until the house was completely full.  Ever notice why older composites are so much bigger?  This meant an average of 10 members per pledge class in house.  Currently 25 brothers live in the house, or an average of 8 brothers per class.  With 15 less brothers living in the house than 10 years ago it isn’t surprising the house feels empty and alumni complain about how good things used to be.</p>

		<p><i>What happens when <span data-var="noPayHouseBill" class="TKAdjustableNumber" data-min="1" data-max="10"> brothers</span> per semester don’t pay their house bill?</i></p>

		<p><i>What if no brothers were allowed to graduate with debt to the house and recent alumni payed back their debt to the house?</i></p>

		<p><i>What if there were no depledges?</i></p>

		<p><i>What if 2 brothers per pledge class debrothered?</i></p>
