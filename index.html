<h1> Brotherhood: By the Numbers</h1>
<p>
    Is the house bill too high?  This semester we voted for a house bill of $3,985, the 
    highest house bill Pilam has ever had.  Yet you could argue that we pay about the 
    same as someone in a Baker Quad if you include 
    food (the cheapest on campus housing) and so maybe we aren’t doing so bad.  In this sort of essay I don’t want to make 
    the decision for you but give you a perspective on what is really impacting our house 
    bill.  This does not mean to question individual reasons for living on campus but to emphasize the purely financial aspects of Pilam and
    the cost of keeping our house at 450 Beacon Street.

    This is an interactive essay. The numbers and formulas behind our financials
    are included with the words so that changing their values changes the text.
    Text that is blue can be dragged left and right to change it's value.

<h2>The Housing Bylaw Change</h2>

<p>
    First, a little history.  In 2012, the Pilam Corporation wanted to raise the rent we 
    pay to stay at 450 Beacon because of rising costs.  The undergraduate representatives 
    resisted this proposal, citing that the an increase in the rent with so few brothers 
    living in the house would push the house bill over $4000.  The Pilam Coorporation took 
    this as a sign that our policies on brothers moving in the house and rushing were too 
    relaxed.  Without higher numbers we would not be able to afford 450 Beacon.  The undergrad’s rebuttal 
    was a new addition to our chapter’s bylaws that would guarantee enough money was 
    brought in by each pledge class.  The exact text is below:
</p>

<blockquote>
    Section 4: Living in the House
    <br>
    A. All members shall live in the house the first semester they are able. <strong>At 
    minimum a pledge class is responsible for paying for 12 house bills. If the pledge 
    class has fewer than 12 active members, the pledge class is responsible for paying 
    for as many house bills as there are active members in that pledge class.</strong> 
    With the understanding that no rule can accommodate all situations, if a brother is 
    unable to abide by this policy, the Judicial Chairman shall form a committee to review 
    the reasons for living out-of-house. If the committee decides that the brother does 
    not have sufficient reason to live out-of-house, the committee may enforce penalties 
    on the brother under review which may include, but are not limited to fines or 
    placement in bad standing. For brothers initiated prior to the year 2012, penalties 
    will not be applied.
</blockquote>

<p>
    The bylaw was meant to be a motivator on two fronts: to guarantee a relatively stable 
    house bill and the necessity of having larger pledge classes. 
    So far neither of these goals have been met.  Judicial committees have been voting to 
    not follow the bylaw and have waived the fees. This isn't surprising because no one wants
    a pledge class to be charged a fee but it affects what everyone pays.
</p>

<h2>A different style of budget meeting</h2>

<p>
Imagine if in the budget meeting instead of differentiating between in house and on 
campus brothers, we assumed that every eligible brother lived in the house.
Let us say there are 
<span data-var="a_newbros" class="TKAdjustableNumber" data-min="5" data-max="18"> new brothers</span>
who are freshman and required to live on campus and don't count in this number.
For Spring 2015 this would have meant a house bill of 
$<strong><span data-var="a_allin_housebill" data-format="%.0f"></span></strong> 
instead of the actual $3975.  Let’s say 
<span data-var="a_nbro_outhouse" class="TKAdjustableNumber" data-min="1" data-max="20"> brothers</span> 
then announced that they did not want to live in the house.  Lack of contribution by 
the brothers living out of the house would be moved to the brothers living in the house.
Every in house brother would have to write an addition check for 
<strong>$<span data-var="a_inhouse_extrafee" data-format="%.0f"></span></strong>.  
Perhaps the brothers' reasons for not moving in the house would convince everyone to pick up the 
$<span data-var="a_inhouse_extrafee" data-format="%.0f">, perhaps not.  People deciding 
to live on campus isn’t seen this way, but this is what is happening.  
Would you pay for another brother to live on campus?

<h2>Play with the numbers</h2>

<p>
Play with the model below to get a glipse of the next five years of Pilam.
What if the size of every class went up by one?
What if every pledge class has 12 members?
How does this affect rush?
